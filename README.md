# trizen-pac

**trizen** wrapper to mimic yaourts search feature
Forked from [XenGi's pac for **pacaur**](https://github.com/XenGi/pac)

To keep compatability with the original pac, the command for trizen-pac is `tpac`. 
If you want to use `pac`, just use an alias.

trizen-pac takes your arguments and just gives them to trizen. Additionally it adds a few useful arguments and if none are
given except a search pattern it mimics the search function of yaourt and gives you a list of results. Then you just
type the package numbers you want to install instead of having to type the names.


Example of how the search function works:
